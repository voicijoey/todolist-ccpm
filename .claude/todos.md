# Authentication System Implementation - Issue #3 ✅ COMPLETED

## Authentication Routes and Controllers ✅
- [x] Create auth controller with register/login logic
- [x] Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Add JWT token generation and validation
- [x] Create authentication middleware
- [x] Implement protected route examples

## API Endpoints ✅
- [x] POST /api/auth/register - User registration
- [x] POST /api/auth/login - User login
- [x] POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
- [x] POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh
- [x] GET /api/auth/profile - Get user profile (protected)
- [x] PUT /api/auth/profile - Update user profile (protected)

## Security Features ✅
- [x] Password strength validation
- [x] Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [x] JWT middleware for route protection
- [x] User context extraction from tokens
- [x] Error handling for authentication

## Testing and Documentation ✅
- [x] Create comprehensive authentication tests
- [x] Update API documentation
- [x] Validate security implementation

## Manual Testing Results ✅
- ✅ User registration works with validation
- ✅ User login returns JWT tokens
- ✅ Protected routes require valid tokens
- ✅ Profile updates work correctly
- ✅ Validation errors return proper responses
- ✅ Password hashing implemented with bcrypt
- ✅ Rate limiting active on auth endpoints

## Implementation Summary
The authentication system has been successfully implemented with:
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- Input validation with express-validator
- Rate limiting for security
- Protected route middleware
- User profile management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Token refresh mechanism

All core authentication features are working and tested!
