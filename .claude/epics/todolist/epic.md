# Epic: todolist

## Overview

A modern web-based personal task management system built with a focus on simplicity and performance. The implementation uses a lightweight tech stack with server-side rendering for optimal performance and progressive enhancement for advanced features. Core architecture emphasizes minimal dependencies and leverages modern web standards for notifications, storage, and responsive design.

## Architecture Decisions

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (or lightweight framework like Alpine.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity (with PostgreSQL migration path)
- **Authentication**: JWT with local storage + httpOnly cookies
- **Notifications**: Web Push API + email fallback
- **Deployment**: Single server deployment with Docker containerization

**Key Design Patterns:**
- RESTful API design for clean separation of concerns
- Progressive Web App (PWA) approach for offline capability
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Event-driven notifications system
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

**Rationale:**
- SQLite chosen for zero-configuration deployment and excellent performance for single-user scenarios
- Vanilla JavaScript/Alpine.js to minimize bundle size and complexity
- Server-side rendering for fast initial page loads
- JWT authentication for stateless API design

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Components:**
- TaskList: Main task display with filtering and sorting
- TaskForm: Create/edit task modal or inline form
- TaskItem: Individual task row with quick actions
- FilterBar: Search, category, priority, and date filters
- Dashboard: Analytics and productivity overview
- NotificationCenter: Browser notification management

**State Management:**
- Lightweight client-side state using vanilla JavaScript or Alpine.js store
- Local storage for offline task viewing
- Optimistic updates with error rollback
- Real-time UI updates via WebSocket (Phase 2)

**User Interaction Patterns:**
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N for new task, Enter to save, Esc to cancel)
- Drag-and-drop for priority reordering
- Bulk selection with checkbox controls
- Quick inline editing for task titles

### Backend Services

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/tasks              # List tasks with filtering
POST   /api/tasks              # Create new task
GET    /api/tasks/:id          # Get specific task
PUT    /api/tasks/:id          # Update task
DELETE /api/tasks/:id          # Delete task
POST   /api/tasks/bulk         # Bulk operations
GET    /api/analytics          # Productivity statistics
POST   /api/auth/login         # User authentication
POST   /api/notifications      # Notification preferences
```

**Data Models:**
```sql
tasks (
  id, title, description, priority, status,
  category, due_date, created_at, updated_at, completed_at
)
users (
  id, email, password_hash, created_at, preferences
)
notifications (
  id, user_id, task_id, type, scheduled_at, sent_at
)
```

**Business Logic Components:**
- TaskService: CRUD operations and business rules
- NotificationService: Email and browser notification handling
- AnalyticsService: Productivity metrics calculation
- AuthService: Authentication and session management

### Infrastructure

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Docker container with multi-stage build
- Single server deployment (VPS or cloud instance)
- SQLite database with automatic backups
- Nginx reverse proxy for static asset serving

**Scaling Considerations:**
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limiting
- Static asset caching with proper cache headers
- CDN for static assets (Phase 3)

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Application logging with structured format
- Basic health check endpoint
- Performance monitoring for API response times
- Error tracking and alerting

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Approach:**
- API-first development with OpenAPI specification
- Test-driven development for critical business logic
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with SQLite, plan PostgreSQL migration path
- Implement authentication early for security validation
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of complex features
- Extensive testing with realistic data volumes

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing with 1000+ tasks
