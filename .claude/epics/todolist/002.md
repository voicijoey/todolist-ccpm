## Description
Implement JWT authentication, user registration/login, and session management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register
- [ ] User can login
- [ ] JWT tokens work
- [ ] Protected routes

## Technical Requirements

### User Registration
- Input validation
- Password hashing
- Email verification (optional)
- Duplicate user prevention

### User Login
- Credential validation
- JWT token generation
- Refresh token mechanism
- Login attempt limiting

### Session Management
- JWT middleware
- Token validation
- Protected route decorator
- User context extraction

### Security Features
- Password strength requirements
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Security headers

## Dependencies
- [001] Database Schema & API Foundation (needs database tables and API structure)

## Implementation Notes
This task establishes the security foundation for the application. Must be completed before implementing core task operations to ensure proper user isolation.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User registration endpoint working
- [ ] User login endpoint working
- [ ] JWT tokens generated and validated
- [ ] Protected routes middleware implemented
- [ ] Password hashing working
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Authentication tests passing
