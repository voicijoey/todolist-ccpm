## Description
Implement email notifications and browser notifications for due dates and overdue tasks

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Browser notifications functional
- [ ] User preferences

## Technical Requirements

### Email Notifications

- Overdue task reminders
- User email preferences
- Email template system

### Browser Notifications

- Permission handling
- Real-time notification triggers
- Notification sound/visual alerts
- Notification history

### User Preferences
- Notification settings panel
- Email/browser toggle options
- Timing preferences (how many hours/days before due)
- Frequency settings (daily digest vs individual)
- Notification categories

### Notification Logic
- Due date calculation
- Overdue detection
- Notification scheduling
- Duplicate prevention
- Batch notification handling

## Dependencies
- [003] Core Task CRUD Operations (needs core tasks for notification triggers)

This is an independent notification system that enhances the core todo functionality. Can be implemented in parallel with other features since it depends only on the basic task model.
