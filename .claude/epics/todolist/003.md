## Description
Implement basic task creation, reading, updating, and deletion with API endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations work
- [ ] Basic task model
- [ ] API endpoints functional

## Technical Requirements

### Task Model
- Task data structure
- Validation rules
- User relationship
- Status management

### Create Operations
- Task creation endpoint
- Input validation
- User authorization
- Success/error responses

### Read Operations
- List user tasks
- Get single task
- Filtering and sorting
- Pagination support

### Update Operations
- Task modification endpoint
- Partial update support
- Ownership validation
- Status transitions

### Delete Operations
- Task deletion endpoint
- Soft delete vs hard delete
- Ownership validation
- Cascade handling

## Dependencies
- [001] Database Schema & API Foundation (needs database tables and API structure)
- [002] Authentication System Implementation (needs user authentication for task ownership)

## Implementation Notes
This task implements the core functionality of the todo list application. Requires both database foundation and authentication to ensure tasks are properly isolated per user.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task creation endpoint working
- [ ] Task retrieval endpoints working
- [ ] Task update endpoint working
- [ ] Task deletion endpoint working
- [ ] User task isolation enforced
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling in place
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] CRUD operation tests passing
