## Immediate Next Steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Priority 1: Foundation Development
1. **Start Sequential Tasks**: Begin with issues #2, #3, #4 (foundation layer)
   - Database schema and API setup
   - Authentication system implementation
   - Core CRUD operations

### ðŸš€ Priority 2: Parallel Development
2. **UI & Features**: Once foundation is ready, start parallel work on issues #5-#9
   - UI components development
   - Feature implementations (priority, search, notifications, analytics)

### ðŸ“‹ Development Commands Ready
- `/pm:issue-start {2-9}` - Begin work on specific task
- `/pm:epic-start todolist` - Launch parallel development mode
- `/pm:status` - Check overall progress

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Sequential)**: Foundation tasks must complete in order
- Issue #2: Database & API Foundation (16 hours)
- Issue #3: Authentication System (12 hours)
- Issue #4: Core Task CRUD (14 hours)

**Phase 2 (Parallel)**: Independent features can run simultaneously
- Issue #5: UI Components (20 hours)
- Issue #6: Priority & Categories (8 hours)
- Issue #7: Search & Filtering (12 hours)
- Issue #8: Notifications (16 hours)
- Issue #9: Analytics & Export (14 hours)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 102 hours (~13 working days)

## Risk Mitigation
- Authentication security review planned early
- Performance testing with 1000+ tasks
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Email service integration contingency plans

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Task operations < 500ms response time
- 90% user satisfaction with task workflow
- Support for 1000+ tasks without degradation
