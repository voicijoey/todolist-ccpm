**Repository**: https://github.com/voicijoey/todolist-ccpm

## Recent Achievements

### ✅ Completed (2025-09-20 to 2025-09-21)
- **PRD Creation**: Comprehensive product requirements document created
- **Epic Planning**: Technical implementation plan established
- **Task Decomposition**: 8 actionable tasks defined with clear dependencies
- **GitHub Integration**: All issues synced to GitHub with proper parent-child relationships
- **Repository Setup**: Git repository initialized and connected to GitHub
- **Worktree Creation**: Development environment prepared at `../epic-todolist`
- **Core Implementation**: Full-stack todo application implemented with Node.js/Express backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend
- **Database Integration**: SQLite database with proper schema for tasks and users
- **Authentication System**: Complete user registration, login, logout with JWT tokens
