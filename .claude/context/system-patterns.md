# System Patterns Context

## Architectural Patterns

### CCPM Framework Architecture
**Pattern**: Command-Agent-Context (CAC) Architecture
- **Commands**: Markdown-based operations with frontmatter permissions
- **Agents**: Specialized sub-agents for context optimization and heavy lifting
- **Context**: Persistent project knowledge and session state management

### Epic Management Pattern
**Pattern**: Hierarchical Task Decomposition with GitHub Integration
```
PRD → Epic → Tasks → GitHub Issues → Implementation → Delivery
```
- **Local Development**: Private workspace in `.claude/epics/`
- **Public Tracking**: GitHub Issues with parent-child relationships
- **Sync Strategy**: Controlled synchronization between local and remote state

### Agent Coordination Pattern
**Pattern**: Context Firewall with Hierarchical Delegation
```
Main Conversation (Strategic Level)
├── code-analyzer Agent → Deep code analysis with concise summaries
├── file-analyzer Agent → File content extraction and summarization
├── test-runner Agent → Test execution with comprehensive logging
└── parallel-worker Agent → Multi-stream coordination and execution
```

## Design Patterns in Use

### Frontmatter-Driven Configuration
**Pattern**: YAML frontmatter for metadata and permissions
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, LS, Task
name: command-identifier
status: operational-state
created: iso-datetime
---
```
**Benefits**: Declarative configuration, tool permission control, metadata tracking

### Progressive Enhancement Pattern
**Implementation Strategy**: Build core functionality first, enhance with advanced features
1. **Base Layer**: Core task management (CRUD operations)
2. **Enhancement Layer**: Advanced features (search, filtering, analytics)
3. **Progressive Layer**: Offline capabilities, advanced notifications

### API-First Design Pattern
**Strategy**: Design APIs before implementing UI components
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Document all endpoints before implementation
- **Contract-First Development**: UI and backend teams work from same contract
- **Testing Strategy**: API testing independent of UI implementation

## Data Flow Patterns

### Task Management Flow
```
User Input → Validation → Business Logic → Database → Response → UI Update
```
**Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, rollback on error
**Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
**State Management**: Centralized state with local storage backup

### Notification Flow
```
Task Events → Notification Service → Channel Selection → Delivery → User Acknowledgment
```
**Multi-Channel**: Email, browser notifications, in-app alerts
**User Preferences**: Configurable notification settings
**Retry Logic**: Failed delivery handling with exponential backoff

### Analytics Flow
```
User Actions → Event Tracking → Data Aggregation → Report Generation → Visualization
```
**Privacy-First**: No personal data tracking, usage patterns only
**Real-Time**: Live dashboard updates for immediate feedback
**Export Capability**: Data portability for user autonomy

## Integration Patterns

### GitHub Synchronization Pattern
**Strategy**: Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
- **Local State**: Authoritative for development work
- **Remote State**: Authoritative for collaboration and visibility
- **Sync Points**: Explicit synchronization commands
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification

### Authentication Pattern
**Strategy**: JWT with HTTP-only cookies for security
```
Login Request → Credential Validation → JWT Generation → Secure Cookie → Protected Access
```
**Session Management**: Automatic token refresh with sliding expiration
**Security**: XSS protection via HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection

### Database Abstraction Pattern
**Strategy**: Database-agnostic design for migration flexibility
- **Development**: SQLite for simplicity and speed
- **Production**: PostgreSQL for robustness and features
- **Migration Path**: Zero-downtime migration strategy
- **Query Layer**: ORM/Query Builder for database independence

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
**Strategy**: System continues functioning with reduced capabilities
- **Offline Mode**: Task viewing when network unavailable
- **Service Degradation**: Core features work if advanced features fail
- **User Communication**: Clear error messages with suggested actions

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Implementation**: Prevent cascade failures in external services
- **Email Service**: Fallback to browser notifications
- **Database**: Local storage backup for temporary operations
- **GitHub API**: Local tracking with deferred synchronization

### Validation Pattern
**Strategy**: Multi-layer validation with user feedback
- **Client-Side**: Immediate feedback for user experience
- **Server-Side**: Security and data integrity enforcement
- **Database**: Constraint enforcement at data layer

## Performance Patterns

### Lazy Loading Pattern
**Strategy**: Load data and features on demand
- **Task Lists**: Paginated loading for large datasets
- **Analytics**: Generate reports on request, not continuously
- **UI Components**: Load complex features when accessed

### Caching Strategy
**Multi-Level Caching**: Browser, application, and database levels
- **Browser Cache**: Static assets with appropriate headers
- **Application Cache**: Frequently accessed data in memory
- **Database Cache**: Query result caching for repeated operations

### Batching Pattern
**Strategy**: Group operations for efficiency
- **Bulk Operations**: Multiple task updates in single request
- **Notification Batching**: Combine related notifications
- **Database Operations**: Transaction batching for consistency

## Security Patterns

### Defense in Depth
**Strategy**: Multiple security layers for comprehensive protection
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication capability
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

### Principle of Least Privilege
**Implementation**: Minimal access rights for all components
- **API Permissions**: Endpoint-specific authorization
- **Database Access**: User-specific data isolation
- **File System**: Restricted access to necessary directories only

### Audit Trail Pattern
**Strategy**: Comprehensive logging for security and debugging
- **User Actions**: All significant user operations logged
- **System Events**: Error conditions and state changes tracked
- **Access Logs**: Authentication and authorization events recorded
