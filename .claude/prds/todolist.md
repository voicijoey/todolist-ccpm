# PRD: Todolist

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive personal task management system designed for business professionals to organize, prioritize, and track daily operational tasks. The web-based application provides essential task management capabilities including CRUD operations, prioritization, scheduling, notifications, and analytics to streamline personal business workflow management.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Business professionals struggle with fragmented task management across multiple tools, leading to missed deadlines, unclear priorities, and inefficient workflow organization. Current solutions are either too simple (basic todo apps) or too complex (enterprise project management tools), creating a gap for personal business task management.

**Why is this important now?**
With increasing business complexity and remote work demands, professionals need a dedicated, intuitive system that bridges the gap between personal productivity and business task management without the overhead of team collaboration features.
